## What is this?

This is a repository to hold some of my plugins for the [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com) IRC client.

#### Plugins:

* `smartfilter.ini`:
A plugin to be smart about filtering joins and parts in channels. A configurable idle timeout controls after how many seconds of idling in a specific channel joins and parts of a nick will not be shown in that channel.
